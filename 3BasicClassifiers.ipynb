I'm still a novice in the field, I've been poking around Kaggle for a while now, so this is more of a notebook for myself, to keep track of what I am learning, than an actual guide. Suggestions and comments are more than welcome!  \nI will use three of the simplest classification methods (Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Logistic Regression) and, given the high number of features in this dataset, I will briefly comment on how to reduce their correlation with Principal Component Analysis.",

The 10 first important features (on the left) are taken among the first in the first vectors of the **PCA**, the ones with highest variance, while the least important features for the classifier are mostly among the last vectors of our modified dataset, where the remaining information has been stored. Dropping them would lead to a modest loss of information. Moreover, the actual value of the importance is increased for the first ten vectors and equally low for the last ten.  \nIt is interesting to note how this rearrangement of the information through **PCA** and the elimination of just one descriptor doesn't significantly affect the results for the **Random Forest** classifier.
