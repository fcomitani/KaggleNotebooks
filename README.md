# Kaggle Notebooks

This repository contains samples of my Kaggle ipython notebooks. They follow the python 3 syntax and require input data that can be found on Kaggle servers:

3BasicClassifiers.ipynb ->  A tutorial introducing three of the most commonly used classifiers (Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Logistic Regression), and showing the importance that feature reduction and data pre-processing can have on the final outcome of the prediction (Leaf Classification Dataset)

SimplePitchDetector.ipynb -> Here I developed a basic pitch detection algorithm with three different methods and I analyse the difference in the outcome on a dataset of guitar notes (What is a Note? Dataset)

LogbookAnalysisAndWeatherPrediction.ipynb ->  After a thorough analysis of the wide variety of data contained in the Logbooks dataset a I implemented a quick Neural Network with Theano to predict weather patterns (Ocean Ship Logbooks (1750-1850) Dataset)

UnsupervisedLearningWithSelfOrganizingMapsMNIST -> A quick example of how the SimpSOM library can be used to map pictures from the MNIST dataset (Digit Recognizer Dataset)
