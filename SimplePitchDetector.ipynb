In theory one could use this knowledge to further clean the dataset and remove the tuning error.\n\nUnfortunately the algorithm as it is doesn't seem to perform that well as some of the files are associated with strings different from those indicated in their names, but it was able to identify a few notes correctly.

The frequency ends up being too low, maybe due to noise (but we would observe this effect on more notes) or a bug in the code, which is worth investigating. \n\nIgnoring for a moment theses two outliers, the results for the remaining notes are fairly satisfying.  The respective strings of each note are often indentified correctly, with the exception of B and Ehi, that contain the highest pitch sounds. This is in line with what found in literature, where it is usually observed that autocorrelation is more efficient at mid to low frequencies. In general it seems that the guitar used to record is slightly flat.\n\nLooking at the Scale files, the algorithm correctly recognises the ascending order of the notes, but for some reason there seems to be an offset of two notes lower, Do is seen as an A2 instead of, possibly a C3, Re as a B2 instead of a D3 and so on and so forth. This may be symptom of a systematic error in our algorithm, (maybe in the assignment of the notes).

      "source": "So, as already mentioned, zero crossing gives the poorest results, with a string note prediction slightly lower than the other two methods (especially in low frequency regions of the spectrum), and a relatively high mean difference between the measured frequencies and the predicted notes.\nOn the other hand, although still unable to predict notes perfectly (but the scale is there!), the algorithm based on autocorrelation gives the best results by far, with a very low mean frequency difference (less then a Hertz) and high string predictions. From our results, this methods is less effective at higher frequencies and seems to be affected by a systematic error in the note recognition snippet that should be investigated.\nFinally, the algorithm based on the Fourier Transform is halfway between the other two, with a string prediction similar to that of the autocorrelation method, but an higher mean frequency difference.\n\nIn this notebook, the three algorithms have been implemented in a straightforward and na√Øve way, giving us the chance to observe their different properties and efficacy on the available dataset. Refining their implementation and pre-processing of the sound waves files, to either remove or identify possible sources of noise, however, could easily improve the results and give a more accurate pitch detector.",
